5. **Compatibility**: Most operating systems support various filesystem types (e.g., NTFS for Windows, ext4 for Linux).

## Disadvantages
1. **Fragmentation**: Over time, as files are created and deleted, fragmentation can occur where files are stored non-contiguously on the disk, leading to slower access times.
  
2. **Limited Scalability**: Some older filesystems may struggle with very large datasets or require complex configurations for scalability.
  
3. **Data Loss Risk**: Filesystem corruption due to power failures or software bugs can lead to significant data loss if not properly managed or backed up.

4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: In high-demand environments (e.g., servers), performance may degrade if the filesystem isn’t optimized for concurrent access.

5. **Complex Recovery Processes**: Recovering lost or corrupted files can be complicated depending on the filesystem's design.

## Applications
Filesystems are integral in operating systems for personal computers, servers, mobile devices, etc., enabling users to manage their digital content effectively.


# Database

## Definition
A database is an organized collection of structured information that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and updating of data. Databases can be classified into various types:

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**: Use tables to represent data relationships through foreign keys (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

2. **Non-relational Databases (NoSQL)**: Designed for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g., MongoDB for document storage).

3. **Distributed Databases**: Spread across multiple locations or nodes but appear as a single database (e.g., Google Spanner).

4. **Cloud Databases**: Managed databases hosted on cloud platforms that offer scalability and flexibility (e.g., Amazon RDS).

## Characteristics
1. **Data Integrity Constraints**: Databases enforce rules that maintain accuracy through primary keys and foreign keys.
  
2. **Concurrency Control**: Allow multiple users to access the database simultaneously without conflicts through locking mechanisms.
